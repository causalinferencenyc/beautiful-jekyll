#### Talk title: Minimax-Optimal Policy Learning under Unobserved Confounding
Abstract: We study the problem of learning personalized decision policies from observational data while accounting for possible unobserved confounding. Since policy value and regret may not be point-identifiable, we study a method that minimizes the worst-case estimated regret over an uncertainty set for propensity weights that controls the extent of unobserved confounding. We prove generalization guarantees that ensure our policy will be safe when applied in practice and will in fact obtain the best-possible uniform control on the range of all possible population regrets that agree with the possible extent of confounding. We develop efficient algorithmic solutions to compute this confounding-robust policy. Finally, we assess and compare our methods on synthetic and semi-synthetic data. In particular, we consider a case study on personalizing hormone replacement therapy based on the parallel WHI observational study and clinical trial. We demonstrate that hidden confounding can hinder existing policy learning approaches and lead to unwarranted harm, while our robust approach guarantees safety and focuses on well-evidenced improvement.
This work is joint with Nathan Kallus. An earlier version of this work was circulated as "Confounding-Robust Policy Improvement". 
Time permitting, I will talk about follow-up work on robust evaluation for infinite-horizon reinforcement learning under time-invariant unobserved confounding.

#### Talk title: Personalized Policy Learning using Longitudinal Mobile Health Data
Abstract: Personalized policy represents a paradigm shift from one decision rule for all users to an individualized decision rule for each user. Developing personalized policy in mobile health applications imposes challenges. First, for lack of adherence, data from each user are limited. Second, unmeasured contextual factors can potentially impact on decision making. Aiming to optimize immediate rewards, we propose using a generalized linear mixed modeling framework where population features and individual features are modeled as fixed and random effects, respectively, and synthesized to form the personalized policy. The group lasso type penalty is imposed to avoid overfitting of individual deviations from the population model. We examine the conditions under which the proposed method work in the presence of time-varying endogenous covariates, and provide conditional optimality andmarginal consistency results of the expected immediate outcome under the estimated policies.We apply our method to develop personalized push (“prompt”) schedules in 294 app users, with the goal to maximize the prompt response rate given past app usage and other contextual factors. The proposed method compares favorably to existing estimation methods including using the R function “glmer” in a simulation study.

#### Talk title: Causal identification of infectious disease intervention effects in a clustered population
Abstract: Causal identification of treatment effects for infectious disease outcomes in interconnected populations is challenging because infection outcomes may be transmissible to others, and treatment given to one individual may affect others’ outcomes. For example, a vaccine given to an individual may affect their risk of infection given exposure to an infectious source, and their transmissibility if they do become infected. Several statistical frameworks have been proposed to measure causal treatment effects in this setting, including structural transmission models, mediation-based partnership models, and randomized trial designs. However, existing estimands for infectious disease intervention effects are of limited conceptual usefulness: Some are parameters in a structural model whose causal interpretation is unclear, others are causal effects defined only in a restricted two-person setting, and still others are nonparametric estimands that arise naturally in the context of a randomized trial but may not measure any biologically meaningful effect. In this paper, we describe a unifying formalism for defining nonparametric structural causal estimands and an identification strategy for learning about infectious disease intervention effects in clusters of interacting individuals. The estimands generalize existing quantities and provide a framework for causal identification in randomized and observational studies. A semi-parametric class of pairwise Cox-type transmission hazard models is used to facilitate statistical inference in finite samples. A comprehensive simulation study compares existing and proposed estimands under a variety of randomized and observational vaccine trial designs.
