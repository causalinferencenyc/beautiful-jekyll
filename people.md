I am an assistant professor in the Department of Biostatistics at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. I completed my PhD in biostatistics at Harvard University with Eric Tchetgen Tchetgen, and did a postdoctoral fellowship with Mark van der Laan in the Group in Biostatistics at UC Berkeley. Broadly, my primary interest is in developing semiparametric methodology for causal inference with applications in areas seeking to bring relief to populations suffering from poverty and disease. My current methodological focus is in interference, measurement error, and mediation analysis; my applied work has largely been in HIV/AIDS.

I am an epidemiologist with research interests in developing and applying causal inference methods to understand social and contextual influences on mental health, substance use, and violence in disadvantaged, urban areas of the United States. My current work focuses on developing methods for transportability and mediation, and subsequently applying those methods to understand how aspects of the school and peer environments mediate relationships between neighborhood factors and adolescent drug use across populations. More generally, my work on generalizing/ transporting findings from study samples to target populations and identifying subpopulations most likely to benefit from interventions contributes to efforts to optimally target available policy and program resources. I completed a PhD in Epidemiology and an MHS in Biostatistics from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and was a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health and Society Scholar. My research interests are in developing and applying causal inference methods to studying social and contextual influences on mental health and substance use in disadvantaged, urban areas of the United States. Current methodological interests are 1) estimating mediation pathways and 2) predicting effects transported from a source population to a new, target population. Current substantive interests are mental health and substance use in adolescents, contextual drivers of violence, and studying interventions aimed at altering these contextual factors.

I'm an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics in the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University. My research focuses mostly on causal inference: developing statistical methods and machine learning tools to support inference about treatment effects, interventions, and policies. Current research topics include structure learning (a.k.a. causal discovery or causal model selection), semiparametric inference, time series analysis, and missing data. I also work on algorithmic fairness: understanding and counteracting the biases introduced by data science tools deployed in socially-impactful settings. Finally, I have interests in the philosophy of science and the foundations of statistics. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Johns Hopkins University. I completed my PhD at Carnegie Mellon University in 2017 and earned my BA from Columbia University in 2011.

### [Linda Valeri](https://www.lindavaleri.com/)

I am an Assistant Professor in Biostatistics at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and Adjunct Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. I joined Columbia Mailman School of Public Health in 2018 after 3 years as faculty at the Laboratory of Psychiatric Biostatistics of McLean Hospital and the Department of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. My research interests are at the intersection of causal inference, biostatistics, epidemiology, and machine learning. I am fond of collaborating with researchers and practitioners in the biomedical and social sciences and of translating statistical methods in Public Health to improve our understanding of mental health, environmental determinants of health, and health disparities. My research is published in internationally recognized statistics and epidemiology journals and  teaching causal inference to broad audiences is an important mission in my academic activities. I have been invited to teach courses on causal inference and causal mediation analysis by national and international institutions.  I am the recipient of an NIH Career Development Award to develop causal inference methodology for mobile health studies in Psychiatry. I completed a BA and MSc in Economics and Social Sciences (cum laude) at Bocconi University in 2006 and 2008, a PhD in Biostatistics at Harvard University in 2013 (mentor: Tyler VanderWeele) and a postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in 2015 (mentors: Brent Coull and Xihong Lin).

### [Ivan Diaz](https://www.idiaz.xyz/)

My research focuses on the development of non-parametric statistical methods for causal inference from observational and randomized studies with complex datasets, using machine learning. This includes but is not limited to mediation analysis, methods for continuous exposures, longitudinal data including survival analysis, and efficiency guarantees with covariate adjustment in randomized trials. I am also interested in general semi-parametric theory, machine learning, and high-dimensional data. My substantive research has so far focused on clinical applications, specifically neurology, pulmonary and critical care, and precision medicine for cancer.

I am currently a 5th-year Ph.D. student (graduating May 2020) working with Forrest W. Crawford, in the School of Public Health at Yale University. I am interested in developing statistical tools to solve real-world problems in epidemiology and public health. My current research projects center around evaluating infectious disease outcomes, and use methods covering causal inference, survival analysis, and non-parametric estimation.
