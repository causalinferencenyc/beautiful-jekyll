This group is comprised of a multi-disciplinary group of students and faculty from NYC area-based institutions, who are interested in the application and development of statistical methods for drawing causal inferences about intervention effects from partially-controlled studies, or from randomized controlled trials with complications such as non-compliance or missing data.  We have open group meetings approximately once per month, with speakers.  For a calendar of events see the "talks and events" tab above.
